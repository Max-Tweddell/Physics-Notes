Part 1: Motion
--------
To describe motion we need some key terms.

### Key terms

- **Velocity**
Velocity measures the rate of change of displacement. It is measure in $ms^{-1}$
It has the symbol $v$.
It is the vector quantity of speed. Speed is the magnetude of velocity.
$$ V ={ \Delta S\over \Delta T}$$

- **Displacement**  
Displacement measures how far a point if from an origin. It is measured in metres and is a vector quantity . *it has the symbol, $s$*

- **Average velocity**  
Total distance covered divided by time elapsed

- **Instantaneous velocity**
Rate of change of displacement at a particular instant
-  **Acceleration**
The rate of change of velocity the symal is $a$.
The unit it $ms^{-2}$. It is a vector
$$Acceleration = {\Delta V \over \Delta T}$$
$$V_{final} - V_{initial} = \Delta V$$
-

#### Displacement / Time graph
- A **curved** line means that velocity is changing i.e accelerating
- A **steeper** line indicates a higher velocity
- A **negative** gradient means that the object is going in the opposite direction
- A **zero** gradient means that the object is stationary

#### Velocity / Time graph

- The gradient of a ${V \over T}$  graph is ${\Delta V \over \Delta T}$ which is the acceration.
- The area under a $v \ t$ graph gives us the total displacement
- A zero gradient means velocity is constant
- A negative gradient means either: It is decelerating in a $+$ direction or it is accelerating in a $-$ direction


#### Kinematic equations for uniformly accelerated motions


#### Using SUVAT equations, a stopwatch and a ball to find the accereration due to gravity

1. Measure the height (gives us displacement)
2. Drop ball and measure time taken to travel distance
3. We know the initial velocity ($u$) is zero
4. Calculate accereration ($a$) using SUVAT equation



#### Measured distance, $s = 4.53\pm 0.05m \pm 0.011%$

Measured time
```

```

$t=0.937 \quad uncertainty = {1.07 -0.84 \over 2} = 0.115 \pm 0.11$
$t_{average} = 0.9 \pm 0.1s$

$a = {2s \over t^2}= {2 \times 4.53 \over 0.9^2}= 11.2 ms^{-2} \qquad$
$a_{min}= {2\times 4.48 \over 1.0^2} = 8.96 ms^{-2}$   
$a_max ={2 \times 4.58 \over 0.8^2} \qquad uncertainty = {a_{max} a_{min} \over 2}  = 2.67 \approx 3\quad$
 $then \ a = 11\pm3ms^{-2}$

 Using rule for propagating uncertainties
 $$a = {2\times s\over t^2}  \ \mathsf{absolute \ uncertainty\ in $2s$} = 0.05 +0.05$$
So real uncertainty in $2s = {0.1 \over 9.06} = 0.011$

Total real uncertainty in $0.11+0.11+0.011=0.231$   Total absolute uncertainty is $0.231 \times (\mathsf{best \ estimate \ of \ a})= 0.231 \times 11.2 = 2.5872 \approx 3$

#### Finding acceleration of fan cart

##### Variables
- $u = 0$
- $t =$ measured
- $s = 1.0m$
- $a = ?$   

#### What equation will we use?
$$S = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

#### What should we measure?
(slow)Time$= 2.14\ 2.06\ 2.08$ Average $2.09s \pm 0.04$
(fast)Time$= 1.81 \ 1.86\ 1.76$ Average $1.81 \pm0.05$

#### Rearrange & solve
Slow $a = 0.458ms^{-2} \quad {2 \times 1 \over 2.09^2} \quad a_{max} = 0.0499 \quad {2 \times 1.05 \over 2.05^2} \quad a_{min} = 0.419 \quad {2.095 \over 2.13^2}$


$\ $

$$uncertainty(a) ={0.499-0.419 \over 2} = 0.04$$
$$ a = 0.46 \pm 0.04ms^{-2}$$

###### Fast   
$a = {2 \times 1 \over 1.81^2} =  0.61ms^{-2}$

$a_{min} = {2 \times 1.05  \over 1.76^2} = 0.549ms^{-2}$

$a_{max} = {2 \times 0.95 \over 1.81^2} = 0.677ms^{-2}$
$${a_{max}-a_{min} \over 2} =0.06 $$
$$ a = 0.61 \pm 0.06ms^2$$


Relative Motion 2D
--------

$$V_{CrB} = V_{CrG} - V_{BrG} $$

1. **A plane** has an airpseed of $200ms^{-1} (V_{P r A})$ north (000).
The wind has a relative velocity to the ground of $40ms^{-1}$ east (090)
*What is the planes velocity relative to the ground?*

$V_{P r A}$  
$V_{A r G}$  
$V_{P r G}$
$$V_{P r A} = V_{P r G} - V_{A r P}$$
$$ V_{P r G} = V_{P r A} + V_{A r G}$$
$$ Magnitude \ of \ V_{P r G} = \sqrt{200^2+40^2} = 203.96$$
$$ Bearing\; \theta = tan_1 \left({40\over 200}\right) = 11.3^\circ$$
Bearing in $011.3$


Projectile Motion
------
An object is considered a projectile if the only force acting on it is the force due to gravity.  
The key to working with projectiles is recognising that vertical motion can be considered separately from horizontal motion.

Vertically, projectiles accelerate at $-9.81ms^{-2}$ (due to the force due to gravity)

Horizontally, projectiles travel at a constant velocity (as there are NO horizontal forces).

e.g

Juliet has to throw the keys to the front door 15 metres horizontally. She wants to throw the straight out.

1. For how long will they be in the air?
2. Hence how fast will they need to be thrown to travel 15 m horizontally

1. Vertically $S=20M \; a = -9.8ms^{-2} \;u = 0 \; t= ?$
$$ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
t = \sqrt{{2s\over a}} = \sqrt{{2 \times(-20) \over -9.8}} = 2.020s$$

2. $V ={d \over t}$ when $v$ is constant
She wants keys to go $15m$ in $2.02s$
so $v={15\over 2.02} = 7.4 ms^{-1}$


Solid Friction
-------
This is a force that reists motion.
There are two types:  

>  Static friction: which is the force that prevents a stationary object from sliding across a surface.  

> Dynamic/Kinetic friction: This is the force that tries to slow down an object sliding across as surface.

Friction is due to forces caused by the roughness of the two surfaces in contact
The friction force depends on two things, one of them is the nature of the surfaces.

Two factors affect the size of static friction force.
  1. The normal reaction force $F_N$  
  2. The nature of the two surfaces

$$ F_F \le \mu_s F_n $$
This expression ifs the biggest friction force that these two surfaces can provide when pushed together by the force $F_N$.  
If the the force pushing the object is smaller than $\mu_sF_N$, then the friction will be able to oppose it. If not the object will no longer be in equilibrium

$F_F$ will oppose $F_{push}$ provided that $F_{push} \lt \mu_sF_N$

When the object starts moving the equation for the friction force becomes $$F_{friction} = \mu_DF_N$$
$\mu_d \lt \mu_s$ For any surface

Fores does not depend on surface area in contact.

####### 2.3 Work, Energy and Power

Energy
====



#### Kinetic Energy
###### energy due to motion

$$W = F \times s$$

A force is applied to a mass casuing it to accelerate. How much work is done?

$$ W = ma \times {1 \over 2}at^2$$  
$$= {1 \over 2} \times ma^2t^2 $$
$$ = {1 \over 2}m\left({\Delta V \over \Delta t}\right)^2t^2 =  {1 \over 2}mv_f^2$$

By the work-energy equivalence we see that energy of a body in motion at speed v mist be $K = {1 \over 2}mv^2$

#### Gravitational potential Energy
###### Energy due to the objects position in a gravitational field.
How much work is need to move a mass, $m$, and displacement, $s$ in a gravitational field of strength $g$?

$W = F s$  Assume we moved it at a constant speed and force appllied to lift it was upwards.

$$ W = mg \Delta h$$
$$\Delta E_p = mg \Delta h$$

Conservation of Energy
---------
- In an isolated system the total amount of energy remains constant.  
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be transformed from one object to another or be transformed from one type to another

Elastic potential Energy
-------
Energy stored in stretched of deformed objects.

Hookes laws says that the extension of a spring is proportional to the force is applies and force is in opposite direction to the extension. i.e $F = -kx$  
   Where.  

- $F =$ the tension force ($N$)  
- $k =$ spring constant ($Nm^{-1}$)  
- $x =$ extension ($m$)

  To figure out how much energy is stored in a stretched spring we work out how much work is done to stretch it.

  The work done is the area under an $F -s$ graph

  Area of triangle is 1/2base x Height
  $$ W = {1 \over 2 }\times x \times kx = {1 \over 2}kx^2$$
Work = energy transferred
$$ E_p = {1 \over 2}kx^2$$

e.g An eraser is launched vertically by used a bent ruler.
$$ F = 3.4 N$$
$$ x = -0.05 m \quad F =  -kx$$
$$k = { F\over -x} = {3.4 \over -0.05} = 68Nm^{-1}$$

How high will it go if ruler tip is bent 30cm down?

$$E_{initial} = E_p = {1\over 2}kx^2 \quad = {1 \over 2}\times 68 \times 0.03^2 \quad = 0.0306$$

$$E_f = E_{pg} = mg\Delta h \qquad M_{eraser} = 0.015kg$$
$$= mg(h + 0.03)$$

By conservation of energy $E_{PE} lost = E_{PG} gained$
$$ 0.0306 = 0.015 \times 9.81 \times (h+ 0.03)$$
$$ {0.0306 \over 0.14715} - 0.03 = 0.17795$$ or about 18cm



Power
-----
> Rate of energy transfer $$ P = {\Delta E \over \Delta t} $$

>Work done per unit time $$ P = {W \over \Delta t}$$

It is measured in watts ($W$) which is equivalent to joules per second ($Js^{-1}$)

Using our second definition, we can substitute in the expression for work: $W = Fcos\theta$

Thus the equation for power can be written as $$ P = {Fscos\theta \over \Delta t} $$

If it is moving at a constant speed then we can replace ${S \over \Delta t}$ with $v$
So: $$ P = Fvcos\theta$$


Efficiency
-----



$${Useful \; Energy \; Output \over \ Total \; Energy \; Input} = e$$
$${Power\; out \over Power \; in} = e$$


A ball is launched vertially. Measure height and determine launch psed

$GPE$ gained = $KE$ lost

$$m \times g \times \Delta h = {1 \over 2} \times v^2$$
$$g \times \Delta h = {1 \over 2 } v^2$$
$$ 2 g \times \Delta h = v^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{2g\Delta h} $$
$$= \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 0.89}$$

Mass is 17g , or 0.017kg  - Use this to find the spring constant
$$E_{PE} lost = E_{PG} \; gained$$
${1 \over 2} kx^2 = mg\Delta h \qquad$ | X measured to be 0.073m
$${1 \over 2} k = {mg\Delta g \over x^2}$$
$$k = {2mg\Delta h \over x^2}$$
$$= {2 \times 0.017 \times 9.81 \times 0.89 \over 0.073^2}$$
$$ = 55.70474Nm^{-1} \approx 56 Nm^{-1}$$


Momentum
----------
Can be thought of  "as hard it is to stop a thing that is moving"

It is defined as the product of the mass of the object and it's velocity.

$$\vec{P} = m \times \vec{v}$$ Where   
- P is momentum (vector)   
-  m is mass in kg  
- v is velocity in $ms^{-1}$

### Conservation of momentum
The total momentum of the system will remain constant unless an outside force acts on the system.

#### Explosions experiment (conservation of momentum)

$$ P_{i1} = 0 \qquad P_{i2} = 0 \qquad P_{itotal} = 0$$
$$P_{f1} = m_1 \times v_1 P_{f2} = m_2 \times v_2$$
$$P_{ftotal} = P_{f1} + P_{f2} $$
$$P_{f1} = 0.50 \times 0.49 = 0.245 kgms^{-1}$$
$$P_{f2} = 0.50 \times 0.50 = 0.25 kgms^{-1}$$
$$P_{ftotal} \approx 0 kgms^{-1}$$
No external fores applied to two trolley system so momentum was conserved, i.e $P_{itotal} = P_{ftotal}$

### Impulse

Impulse is another word for change in momentum.

> Impulse $=F \Delta t = \Delta p$


If we want to stop something that is moving, we need to produce an impulse by applying a force over an amount of time
